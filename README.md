# strava_noise_reduction

Attempting to remove noise from Strava GPX data using Kalman filters.
Very much a work in progress.

Implemented in a Flask app that connects to the Strava API.
Also very much a work in progress.
It runs but usability isn't great, it doesn't have a lot of functionality, and it's ugly as hell.
